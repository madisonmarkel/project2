<h1>Reciprocity</h1>
<p>Reciprocity is an online recipe storage applicationt that lets you create, update, and delete your personal recipes. There is also an added feature of searching for recipes with up to four ingredients that you have in your kitchen to narrow down what you can make. Additionally, from that recipe search, you can view and add desired recipes to your personal recipe book.</p>

<p>To use the application, sign up with your email account, create and password, and log in. From there, you can access all the features listed above.</p>

<p>Reciprocity uses Passport.js and the Spoonacular API. Coding languages used include JavaScript/JQuery, Node.js, Express, and Sequelize.</p>

<p>Reciprocity was created as the second project in the University of Denver's Full Stack Flex Coding Program in 2018.</p>
